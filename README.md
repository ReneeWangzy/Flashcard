# FlashCard Pro

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.


## Overview
FlashCard Pro is a Vue.js-based flashcard application designed to help users learn and memorize information more effectively. Users can create, manage, and review flashcards, supporting various themes and categories. This is a mobile-first application, so it is best experienced on mobile devices to take full advantage of its responsive design and user interface.


## Features
- Create and edit flashcards
- Category management for flashcards
- Supports different learning modes
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Local Storage for data persistence


## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Type-Check, Compile and Minify for Production

```sh
npm run build
```
